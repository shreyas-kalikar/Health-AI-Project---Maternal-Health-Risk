# Health-AI-Project---Maternal-Health-Risk
**Project description**

**Contextualization:** This project focuses on a maternal health risk prediction task based on a Maternal Health Risk dataset collected from the Internet of Medical Devices (IoMT). The dataset's IoMT origin provides a unique opportunity to apply artificial intelligence techniques for modeling, fitting, and predicting in the scenario of digital health. This project aims to identify a minimal subset of IoMT devices most necessary for predicting maternal risk levels using Feature Selection techniques, so that cost for less necessary devices can be saved.

**Problem**: The core problem focuses on optimizing maternal health risk prediction by judiciously selecting a subset of IoMT devices while maintaining predictive accuracy. The challenge lies in striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in feature selection. This involves not only reducing the number of sensors but doing so without compromising the efficacy of predictive models.

**Proposed approach**: For model training, we experiment with five distinct machine learning models and fine tune each of them by the method of grid search. For feature selection, we adopt a correlation-based method and an iterative approach that examines every possible subset of the given features.

**Impact**: The success of this project will impact patients' wellbeing in two aspects: Firstly, aided by AI, accurate diagnoses regarding their maternal health level can be achieved without human effort. Secondly, cost for maternal healthcare can be reduced due to the fact that some unnecessary IoMT device can be safely discarded.

**Objective**: The primary objective of the project is to enhance maternal health risk prediction by leveraging the Maternal Health Risk dataset derived from the Internet of Medical Devices (IoMT). The goal is to employ feature selection techniques to identify a minimal subset of IoMT devices that can predict maternal risk levels accurately. This involves optimizing the balance between accuracy and efficiency in predictive models.In the context of this particular dataset, the objective is to carefully choose the most crucial features from the nine available, creating a refined subset for prediction purposes. Also, we will choose some models that can provide relatively better results. The aim is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in the predictions made using this selected subset.

**Dataset**: The dataset comprises nine health condition related features, all contributing to the classification of patients' maternal health risk levels. Upon scrutinizing the dataset, we identified potential relationships among some features: Notably, weight exhibits correlations with physical health, potentially influencing blood pressure level, blood sugar level, and heart rate. Examining the two features related to blood pressure, we observed that high SystolicBP tends to be accompanied by high DiastolicBP, suggesting a certain correlation between them. Additionally, two features (Body temperatures in F and C) are essentially the same data in different units, so one of them can be dropped before fed into machine learning models.

**Approach**: We adopt two methods for feature selection and model training:

*A correlation-based feature selection method: We rank all features by their correlations to the target label, so as to get a rough idea which features could be essential and which can be dropped.
*Training and evaluating distinct machine learning models on all possible subsets of available features: We experiment with five types of machine learning models with different levels of complexity: Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine Classifier, Random Forest, and Forward Neural Network. After thoroughly training and fine-tuning each type of models on every subsets of features, we evaluate the models' performance metrics (accuracy score, recall score, F1 score, precision score) and pick the best combination of model and feature subset as our conclusion.

**Conclusions**: In the project's final phase, our analysis revealed insightful observations regarding the effectiveness of feature selection in maternal health risk prediction. When utilizing a combination of four features — 'Age', 'SystolicBP', 'DiastolicBP', and 'BS' (Blood Sugar) — our models achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 89%. This indicates that these features, when used together, provide a robust approach for predicting maternal health risks. Interestingly, a slightly reduced number of features, comprising 'Age', 'DiastolicBP', and 'BS' also yielded commendable results, with an accuracy of around 86%.This suggests a flexible approach in feature selection: for optimal accuracy, all four features should be used, but for cost-effective scenarios, the three-feature combination is a viable and efficient alternative.
